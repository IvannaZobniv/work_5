        The University of Montana (often simply referred to as the U; U of M, and
        UM) is a public research university located in Missoula, Montana, in the
        United States. Founded in 1893, the university is the flagship campus of
        the four-campus University of Montana System and is its largest institution.
        The main campus is located at the foot of Mount Sentinel, the mountain bearing
        Missoula's most recognizable landmark, a large hillside letter "M." It is a major
        source of research, continuing education, economic development and fine arts, as well
        as a driving force in strengthening Montana's ties with countries throughout the world.
        The university calls itself a "city within a city," and contains its own restaurants,
        medical facilities, banking, postal services, police department, and ZIP code. The University
        of Montana ranks 17th in the nation and fifth among public universities in producing Rhodes
        Scholars, with a total of 28 such scholars. The University of Montana has 11 Truman Scholars,14
        Goldwater Scholars and 31 Udall Scholars to its name.<br>
        The University of Montana's Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library houses the earliest authorized
        edition of the Lewis and Clark journals. Rolling Stone labelled the university the "most scenic
        campus in America" and Outside magazine called it "among the top 10 colleges nationally for combining
        academic quality and outdoor recreation".

        <p>An act of Congress of February 18, 1881 dedicated 72 sections (46,000 acres or 19,000 hectares) in Montana
          Territory for the creation of the University. Montana was admitted to the Union on November 8, 1889, and the
          Montana Legislature soon began to consider where the state's permanent capital and state university would be
          located. To be sure that the new state university would be located in Missoula, the city's leaders made an
          agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would stay out of the bidding for the new capital
          and would support Helena over its leading competitor, Anaconda. The cities' bids were supported by the rival
          Copper Kings, William A. Clark Marcus Daly, respectively.<br>
          Missoula won the legislative vote for the new university at the Third Montana Legislative Assembly in February
          1893. The University was formally opened in 1895. While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes
          were temporarily held at nearby Willard School. The South Missoula Land Company, owned by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._B._Hammond">  A.B. Hammond,</a> Richard Eddy and Marcus Daly, joined
          with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus. In June 1898 the cornerstone for A.J. Gibson
          designed University Hall was laid and Missoula became "the University City."</p>
